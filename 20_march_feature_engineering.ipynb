    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding in certain situations where the number of unique categories in a categorical variable is high or when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. Here's a practical example to illustrate when nominal encoding is preferred:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario: Sentiment analysis of customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset containing customer reviews of a product or service. One of the features in this dataset is \"Review Category,\" which represents the sentiment category of the customer review. The sentiment categories can be \"Positive,\" \"Neutral,\" \"Negative,\" \"Very Positive,\" \"Very Negative,\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, using one-hot encoding would result in a high-dimensional dataset with many binary features, as each unique sentiment category would be represented by a separate binary column. However, nominal encoding can be a more suitable choice due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduced dimensionality: With a large number of sentiment categories, using one-hot encoding would introduce a significant increase in the number of columns, potentially leading to a high-dimensional dataset. This can make the dataset more computationally expensive to process and can lead to the curse of dimensionality. Nominal encoding avoids this issue by representing each sentiment category with a single numerical label, reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encoding efficiency: Nominal encoding uses a single column to represent each category, resulting in a more memory-efficient representation compared to one-hot encoding. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets, as it reduces memory requirements and speeds up computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maintaining ordinal information: In some cases, the order or hierarchy of the categories may have significance. Nominal encoding can preserve this ordinal information by assigning numerical labels that reflect the inherent order of the categories. One-hot encoding, on the other hand, does not capture ordinal information since each category is represented independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our sentiment analysis example, we can use nominal encoding to assign numerical labels to each sentiment category, such as \"Positive\" as 0, \"Neutral\" as 1, \"Negative\" as 2, \"Very Positive\" as 3, and so on. This approach reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while still allowing the sentiment category information to be used as input for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or when the number of unique categories in a categorical variable is large. It offers computational efficiency, reduces memory requirements, and can preserve ordinal information if present in the categories."
